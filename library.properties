paragraph=Allows an Arduino board to connect to the internet. It can serve as either a server accepting incoming connections or a client making outgoing ones. Very similar to the Arduino WiFi and Ethernet libraries, with many of the same function calls. Supports ESP SDK version 1.1.1 and above (AT version 0.25 and above).
